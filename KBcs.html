                   <p>In the wake of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the new normal. Social distancing requirements have forced people to drastically change their routines. Going out for dinner and a movie with friends has become an increasingly stressful activity. There’s a need to find recipes to cook and movies to watch at home every night of the week. Deciding what to eat and view can be frustrating and time-consuming in the best of times. During a pandemic it’s overwhelming. </p>
                    <p>What if there was a simple, easy to navigate application that took the work out of deciding on the perfect night in? </p>
                    <p>Kickback! is a web application that randomly generates movie and recipe suggestions from the users’ choice of genre and cuisine type. Users visit the site, make two simple decisions, and let the app do the rest of the heavy lifting. After the app provides suggestions, users have the options to click- through to the recipe and save both the movie and recipe for later. Kickback! makes it easier to stay in, relax and enjoy quality time with loved ones.</p>

                    <strong class="interviews">User Interviews</strong> <br><br>
                    <p>To work within the time constraints of only having 2 weeks to design and develop our application, we decided to interview our coding classmates. Our main goals of the user interviews were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="case">Gain insight into how the quarantine was affecting their daily routine.</li>
                        <li class="case">How often did they go out before the stay-at-home orders? </li>
                        <li class="case">How likely were they to cook dinner and watch a movie at home more than twice a week pre-pandemic? During the pandemic?</li>
                        <li class="case">Did they found it difficult to make decisions about recipes and movies? </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="case">Understand how they were using apps to make daily decisions. </li>
                        <li class="case">Were they using apps before the pandemic to make recipe and movie decisions? During? </li>
                        <li class="case">If yes, what were their pain points while using the apps? </li>
                        <li class="case">If yes, what features did they like about the apps?  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The individuals we interviewed ranged from age 21-50; were single, married with children and in relationships. Their professions were student, audio engineer, residential property owner/manager, receptionist, and teaching assistant. With our limited sample, we captured a wide range of ages, life stages, and careers, which helped us in better understanding our broad user base. The information gathered from the interviews revealed some common themes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="case">All of the users were struggling to adjust to the pandemic and often felt overwhelmed by simple decision-making tasks. </li>
                        <li class="case">All of the users had been “moderately” to “very” social outside of their homes’ pre-pandemic. </li>
                        <li class="case">40% of the users were likely to cook at home more than twice a week pre-pandemic. 80% of the users were likely to cook at home more than twice a week during the pandemic.</li>
                        <li class="case">All of the users were likely to watch a movie at home more than twice a week both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. </li>
                        <li class="case">40% of users were using apps to find recipes before the pandemic. 60% of users were using apps to find recipes during the pandemic.</li>
                        <li class="case">All users used streaming apps to find movies to watch pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. </li>
                        <li class="case">Users who used streaming services wanted the search feature to be more specific. There was a general sentiment that there were too many choices returned in searches. </li>
                        <li class="case">Users who used recipe apps found that they couldn’t always save the recipes, which would make it easier to make a grocery list later.  </li>
                        <li class="case">Users who used recipe apps enjoyed the ability to search by cuisine type and cooking difficulty level. Similarly, the users who used the streaming services liked the ability to search by genre. </li>

                     <strong>User Personas</strong><br><br>
                     <p>After the interviews were conducted, I created two user personas to visually represent the information we gathered. These tangible representations reminded us to keep out users’ needs and goals at the center of our design. </p>

                     <p>Recipe and streaming apps are designed to make searching for food and movie ideas easier.  After our initial research, we found that this isn’t always the case. Often streaming apps provide the users with too many choices and recipe apps don’t have enough features to fully satisfy the consumer. With this knowledge, we set out to develop one application that improved upon both recipe and streaming apps. </p>

                    <p>Each teammate created and tested a rapid prototype based on the sketches. We found that there was no way of telling if the information chosen was actually being captured, so we decided to add a button to the design. This also turned out to be a necessary adjustment for engineering, as a button was required for the functionality to work properly. </p>

                    <p>Using our decision flow diagram, wireframe sketches, and feedback from our users, I created an initial set of low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. These take the users through Kickback! First, they get to the site, followed by choosing a cuisine type and movie. After hitting the Kickback button, they are shown one movie and one recipe suggestion. If they want to know more about the recipe, they can clickthrough. To change their recipe and movie choice, or to save the recipe and movie, they return to the Kickback page. Once finished, the user can view their previously saved movies and recipes. </p>

The users suggested we add some instructions for how to maneuver the site. These two modifications would lead to a more enjoyable user experience. </p>

                    <p>Kickback! fills an interesting opening in the market for consumers who are figuring out how to navigate the new realities of social distancing in a post COVID-19 world. It addresses the need consumers have to make quick decisions about recipes and movies on a daily basis. Through future development, KickBack! will allow for brands to serve targeted ads to users.
